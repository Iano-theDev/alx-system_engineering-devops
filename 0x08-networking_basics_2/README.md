# Networking Basics
## Localhost, 0.0.0.0, hostnames, DNS
* Before DNS everyone had the ip addresses to domains locally in the /etc/hosts file
* Localhost is a loopback address 127.0.0.1 that loops back to this address
* 0.0.0.0 is an ip address used by a host before its assigned an ip by eg in the DHCP.
* Netcat (nc) is a network too that can set up socket connection by setting up a host and a client
